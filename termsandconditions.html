              <h2>TERMS OF SALE</h2>

              <p>
                You must be aged 18 or over to purchase alcohol. It is an
                offence to sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 18 in the DK.
                When ordering and making a payment you will be required to
                confirm that you are aged 18 or over. If your order is a gift
                and contains alcohol, the recipient must also be aged 18 years
                or older. An adult over the age of 18 will be required to sign
                for delivery. By placing an order you are offering to purchase a
                product on and subject to the following terms and conditions.
                All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the
                order price. Dispatch times may vary according to availability
                and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force
                majeure for which we will not be responsible. In order to
                contract with peoplelikeus.dk you must be over 18 years of age
                and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank
                acceptable to us. peoplelikeus.dk retains the right to refuse
                any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will
                inform you by email and we will confirm the identity of the
                party which you have contracted with. This will usually be
                peoplelikeus.dk or may in some cases be a third party. Where a
                contract is made with a third party peoplelikeus.dk is not
                acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made
                between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the
                terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you
                undertake that all details you provide to us are true and
                accurate, that you are an authorized user of the credit or debit
                card used to place your order and that there are sufficient
                funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign
                products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are
                subject to such changes.
              </p>

              <h2>(a) Our Contract</h2>

              <p>
                When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement
                e-mail confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be
                an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your
                order. A contract between us will not be formed until we send
                you confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have
                been dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the
                confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be
                included in the contract formed.
              </p>

              <h2>(b) Pricing and Availability</h2>

              <p>
                Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and
                prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may
                occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which
                you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible
                and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the
                correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you
                we will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel and you have
                already paid for the goods, you will receive a full refund.
                Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional
                charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in
                the ‘Total Cost’.
              </p>

              <h2>(c) Payment</h2>

              <p>
                Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard authorization
                check on your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds
                to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited upon
                authorisation being received. The monies received upon the
                debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the
                value of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the goods have
                been despatched and you have been sent a confirmation email the
                monies paid as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the
                value of goods you have purchased as listed in the confirmation
                email.
              </p>
