              <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
              <p class="py-5">
                Our website address is: https://peoplelikeus.dk
              </p>

              <h2>WHAT PERSONNEL DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY WE COLLECT IT</h2>

              <h2>COMMENTS</h2>
              <p>
                When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data
                shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address
                and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An
                anonymized string created from your email address (also called a
                hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are
                using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
                automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your
                profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your
                comment.
              </p>

              <h2>MEDIA</h2>

              <p>
                you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading
                images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors
                to the website can download and extract any location data from
                images on the website.
              </p>

              <h2>COOKIES</h2>

              <p>
                If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your
                name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your
                convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details
                again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last
                for one year. If you have an account and you log in to this
                site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your
                browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data
                and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in,
                we will also set up several cookies to save your login
                information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last
                for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you
                select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If
                you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
                If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be
                saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and
                simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It
                expires after 1 day. Stripe By using this extension, you may be
                storing personal data or sharing data with an external service.
                WPML uses cookies to identify the visitor’s current language,
                the last visited language and the language of users who have
                logged in. While you use the plugin, WPML will share data
                regarding the site through Installer. No data from the user
                itself will be shared. WooCommerce Multilingual will use cookies
                to understand the basket info when using languages in domains
                and to transfer data between the domains. WooCommerce
                Multilingual will also use cookies to identify the language and
                currency of each customer’s order as well as the currency of the
                reports created by WooCommerce. WooCommerce Multilingual extends
                these reports by adding the currency’s information.
              </p>

              <h2>EMBEDDED CONTENT FROM OTHER WEBSITES</h2>

              <p>
                On this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
                articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in
                the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
                website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies,
                embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your
                interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your
                interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and
                are logged in to that website.
              </p>

              <h2>HOW LONG WE CONTAIN YOUR DATA</h2>

              <p>
                If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are
                retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve
                any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in
                a moderation queue. For users that register on our website (if
                any), we also store the personal information they provide in
                their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their
                personal information at any time (except they cannot change
                their username). Website administrators can also see and edit
                that information.
              </p>

              <h2>WHAT RIGHTS WE HAVE OVER YOUR DATA</h2>

              <p>
                If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you
                can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we
                hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You
                can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about
                you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for
                administrative, legal, or security purposes.
              </p>

              <h2>WHERE WE SEND YOUR DATA</h2>

              <p>
                Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam
                detection service. We collect information about you during the
                checkout process on our store.

                it. For example, we will store order information for XXX years

                address and billing and shipping addresses. We will also store
                comments or reviews, if you choose to leave them.
